# Audio Analysis Project

This repository contains the following functionalities:
- Finding the FFT of a .wav or .mp3 file, alongside note detection

The following functionalities are in progress:
- Finding the FFT of a mic input, alongside note detection
- Finding more audio characteristics besides the FT of inputs -- spectral centroid, etc.
